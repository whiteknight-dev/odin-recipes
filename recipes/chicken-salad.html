        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This recipe for homemade chicken salad uses six simple ingredients and takes only 10 minutes to make from start to finish. After that, you can serve it up on salad greens, scoop it into pita bread or half an avocado, roll it up in a tortilla for a wrap, or serve it hot in a quesadilla or chicken melt.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> You'll need cooked chicken, chopped or shredded. If you have leftover roast chicken, grilled chicken, or rotisserie chicken, chicken salad is a great way to use it all up. You can also use canned chicken to make chicken salad (drain it first), or you can cook chicken for chicken salad. Use white or dark meat, or a combination of both if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Mayonnaise:</strong> Creamy mayonnaise binds together all the separate ingredients for chicken salad into a satisfying mixture of flavors and textures. Use your choice of regular or reduced fat mayonnaise. In this chicken salad recipe, the mayonnaise is enhanced with a tablespoon of lemon juice for brightness and a Â¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Taste the dressing before mixing it with the chicken; you may find it needs a little salt or other flavor-booster from your spice collection.</li>
            <li><strong>Celery:</strong> Fresh, crisp celery adds both flavor and crunch. Be sure to chop the celery into small, uniform pieces so it's easier to eat.</li>
            <li><strong>Almonds:</strong> Here's the secret ingredient that makes this chicken salad recipe stand apart. Blanched slivered almonds (available at any grocery store) are quickly pan-toasted to bring out their nutty flavor, and then added to the chicken salad mixture..</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place almonds in a frying pan. Toast over medium-high heat, shaking frequently. Watch carefully, as they burn easily.</li>
            <li>Mix together mayonnaise, lemon juice, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Toss with chicken, toasted almonds, and celery.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
